EnergyBase

- this is base class for every agent
- property "self.energy" is used for describing how many percent of energy this agent has left
- property "self.working_modes" is a list which contains every possible working mode
- property "self.mode_percentages" is a dictionary which contains keys (working modes) and values (how many
    percentages of energy agent gains or loses during certain working mode)
- method "self.update_energy()" is used to calculate new agents' energy, after certain period of time (deltat) - 
    this change of time depends on working mode that agent containts in that exact moment
