# Optimization of energy flow in multi-agent robotic system

In this repository I am working on developing model of energy exchange between multiple robots included in subCULTron project. 

## Code and data organization
``` tex
master_mussels
├── data_structures.py - definition of agents' classes
├── dependencies.txt - documentation, dependencies and installations
├── explained.txt - documentation
├── init.txt - initialization file
├── main.py - contains parser for init file, small scenario
├── scenarios.py - multiple scenarios sperated in functions
├── topology.py - Topology class, 2D plot of agents in x-y coordinates
├── unit_tests.py - some tests, not updated
```
